Explain the difference between PUT and POST with examples

1. PUT (Update or Replace)
Purpose:
PUT is used to update an existing resource or create it only if it doesn’t already exist.
**Key Characteristics**
1. Idempotent → Calling PUT multiple times produces the same result.
2. Client specifies the resource location (URL).
3. Used for full update or replace.
*Example : Updating a User
PUT /users/101
{
  "name": "Savvitha",
  "email": "savvi@example.com"
}
*Meaning:
Replace the details of user with ID 101.
Even if you send this same request 10 times, the result stays same → user remains updated.


2.POST (Create New Resource)
Purpose:
POST is used to create a new resource on the server.
**Key Characteristics**
1. Not idempotent → Calling POST multiple times creates multiple records.
2. Server decides the new resource location (ID).
3. Used for creating or submitting data.
*Example : Creating a New User
POST /users
{
  "name": "Savvitha",
  "email": "savvi@example.com"
}
